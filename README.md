# Data Preparation for the On the Same Page project

Raw data was scrapped using [GoodreadsScraper](https://github.com/havanagrawal/GoodreadsScraper), which is forked in [this organization](https://github.com/On-the-Same-Page/fork-GoodreadsScraper), in jsonlines format.

Additional data was "scrapped" from the list webpages, using [javascript code](/get-data.js), such as year published, rank in the list, Goodreads score.

check ratings x ranking as ranking decreases (and have fewer votes)
